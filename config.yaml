          - Conducted research on highway traffic safety assessment (using Python and SQL) to analyze accident records and identify risk factors through association rule mining and social network analysis.
          - Developed a predictive model utilizing the CLM-miner algorithm, achieving over 80% accuracy in estimating accident severity under various conditions.
          - Designed and implemented an intuitive tool with data visualization techniques (using matplotlib), to facilitate rapid accident response and support traffic safety decisionmaking.

          - Enhanced 3DGS via MVS integration (MVSGS), utilizing denser point clouds for superior reconstruction quality and robustness compared to sparse-input 3DGS methods, improving overall fidelity.
          - Implemented novel density optimization strategies, including adaptive filtering and cloning/splitting, effectively balancing reconstruction fidelity gains (up to 3dB PSNR increase) with computational efficiency.
          - Evaluated MVSGS on benchmarks, proving significant performance boosts, especially >16dB PSNR gains in sparse views, and general  ̃1.4-2.5dB improvements over baseline 3DGS.

          - Developed a WCNN and CAM-based model to optimize robot path planning, achieving a 3% improvement in accuracy and greater adaptability compared to conventional CNN and GAN approaches.
          - Implemented a novel optimization algorithm with channel attention mechanism, to balance the trade-off between model accuracy and adaptability in dynamic environments.
          - Evaluated the model’s superior performance using IGD and HV metrics, and visualized Pareto front results to demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-objective optimization.
